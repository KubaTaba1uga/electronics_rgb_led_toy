## Overview

This project consists of a PCB board designed in KiCad and an enclosure designed in OpenSCAD, which can be 3D printed. The circuit allows users to adjust the intensity of red, green, and blue channels of an RGB LED using potentiometers, creating a full range of colors.

## Features

- **RGB Color Mixing**: Adjust potentiometers to mix red, green, and blue light.
- **Custom PCB Design**: PCB board designed using KiCad.
- **3D Printable Enclosure**: Box designed in OpenSCAD for housing the PCB.

## Hardware Components

- **Electronics**:
  - 1 x Common Cathode RGB LED
  - 3 x Potentiometers (e.g., 10kÎ© linear taper)
  - 3 x Current-limiting resistors for the RGB LED (calculate based on your LED specs)
  - 3 x Rocker switches
  - 1 x PCB (design files included)
  - 3 x AAA battery
  - Wires and connectors as needed
  - Some M2 screws
- **Tools Required**:
  - Soldering iron and solder
  - Wire cutters/strippers
  - Multimeter (optional for testing)

## Enclosure Design

- **Software**: OpenSCAD
- **Files**: Enclosure design files are located in the `enclosure/` directory.
- **Printing**: Compatible with most FDM 3D printers; designed for easy assembly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Software**:
  - [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) for viewing/modifying PCB files
  - [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) for viewing/modifying the enclosure
- **Hardware**:
  - Access to a 3D printer for printing the enclosure
  - PCB fabrication service or equipment

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KubaTaba1uga/electronics_rgb_led_toy.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Software**

   - Download and install KiCad and OpenSCAD if you plan to modify the designs.

## Assembly Instructions

### PCB Fabrication and Assembly

1. **Fabricate the PCB**:

   - Use the provided Gerber files in the `output/` directory to fabricate the PCB.
